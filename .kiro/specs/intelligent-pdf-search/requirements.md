# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an intelligent multi-format document search application that provides advanced search capabilities including fuzzy matching for spelling mistakes and semantic understanding of search queries. The application features a native desktop interface built with Tauri and React, with multiple independent windows that can be dragged, docked, and managed like an IDE. The backend uses FastAPI with containerized Elasticsearch for powerful search functionality across multiple document formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD). The system is designed for researchers, legal professionals, and students who need to efficiently navigate large document collections without requiring perfect recall of exact terms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Intelligent Search Engine

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to search for content even when I make spelling mistakes or use different terminology, so that I can find relevant documents without perfect recall of exact terms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a search query with spelling mistakes THEN the system SHALL return relevant results using fuzzy matching with at least 80% accuracy
2. WHEN a user searches for conceptual terms THEN the system SHALL return semantically related content using AI embeddings
3. WHEN a user enters a partial query THEN the system SHALL provide auto-complete suggestions based on indexed document content
4. IF a search returns no exact matches THEN the system SHALL automatically suggest corrected spellings and similar terms
5. WHEN performing fuzzy search THEN the system SHALL highlight the confidence level of each match

### Requirement 2: Multi-Format Document Processing

**User Story:** As a legal professional, I want to search across my entire document collection simultaneously, so that I can find relevant information across multiple case files efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a directory containing PDF, DOCX, TXT, or MD files THEN the system SHALL index all supported document content for searchable text extraction
2. WHEN indexing PDF files THEN the system SHALL extract text while preserving page numbers and document structure using pdfplumber (mandatory library)
3. WHEN indexing DOCX files THEN the system SHALL extract text content and basic formatting information using python-docx
4. WHEN indexing TXT and MD files THEN the system SHALL detect encoding automatically and extract content with metadata preservation
5. WHEN a supported document file is added to the watched directory THEN the system SHALL automatically update the search index within 30 seconds
6. IF a document file is corrupted or password-protected THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing other files without interruption
7. WHEN displaying search results THEN the system SHALL show the source document name, page number (for paginated documents), file type, and surrounding context with highlighted search terms
8. WHEN processing large document collections THEN the system SHALL use parallel processing with joblib to optimize indexing performance

### Requirement 3: Multi-Window Native Desktop Interface

**User Story:** As a student, I want to view search results and documents in independent native windows that I can drag, dock, and manage like an IDE, so that I can efficiently organize my workspace and navigate between multiple documents simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a main search window with search input, filters, results list, and hierarchical topic tree
2. WHEN a user clicks on a search result THEN the system SHALL open a new independent document viewer window with highlighting at the exact location
3. WHEN viewing a PDF in a document window THEN the system SHALL highlight all instances of the search terms on the current page using native PDF rendering
4. WHEN viewing text-based documents (DOCX, TXT, MD) THEN the system SHALL display content with search term highlighting and appropriate formatting in a dedicated window
5. WHEN multiple search results exist in the same document THEN the system SHALL provide navigation controls to jump between matches within the document window
6. WHEN dragging files onto any application window THEN the system SHALL accept and process files using native OS drag-and-drop functionality
7. WHEN managing multiple document windows THEN the system SHALL allow each window to be independently moved, resized, minimized, and closed without affecting other windows

### Requirement 4: Advanced Search Features

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want sophisticated search options and filters, so that I can narrow down results and find exactly what I'm looking for.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enables semantic search THEN the system SHALL use sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2 mandatory model) AI embeddings to find conceptually similar content with cosine similarity threshold of 0.7
2. WHEN a user applies date filters THEN the system SHALL filter results by document creation or modification date with calendar picker interface
3. WHEN a user applies file type filters THEN the system SHALL show only results from selected document types (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD) with multi-select checkboxes
4. WHEN a user searches with boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) THEN the system SHALL respect the logical query structure and highlight operator precedence
5. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL show relevance scores (0.0-1.0) and allow sorting by relevance, date, or document name with visual indicators
6. WHEN browsing the topic hierarchy THEN the system SHALL display documents organized by AI-generated topics with configurable depth (default 3 levels) and document count per topic
7. WHEN a user toggles AI search off THEN the system SHALL fall back to exact and fuzzy search only using pre-encoded content without re-processing
8. WHEN GPU acceleration is available THEN the system SHALL use GPU for AI embedding operations and display GPU status in settings

### Requirement 5: Performance and Responsiveness

**User Story:** As any user, I want the search to be fast and the interface to remain responsive, so that I can work efficiently without waiting for slow operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a search query THEN the system SHALL return initial results within 500ms for core search operations and within 2 seconds for complete UI updates for collections up to 1000 documents
2. WHEN indexing large document files THEN the system SHALL perform indexing in the background using QThread without blocking the UI
3. WHEN loading document previews THEN the system SHALL cache rendered pages using LRU eviction for faster subsequent access
4. WHEN the search index is being updated THEN the system SHALL continue to serve search requests from the existing index
5. WHEN memory usage exceeds 1GB THEN the system SHALL implement automatic cleanup of cached data
6. WHEN processing multiple document formats THEN the system SHALL use parallel processing with joblib for CPU-bound operations
7. WHEN GPU acceleration is available THEN the system SHALL use GPU for AI embedding operations and fall back to CPU when unavailable

### Requirement 6: Native Desktop Application with Backend Services

**User Story:** As a user, I want easy setup and configuration of the application, so that I can start using it quickly without complex technical setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user first runs the native application THEN the system SHALL automatically detect, start, and manage required backend services (FastAPI backend, Elasticsearch) with health verification within 30 seconds
2. WHEN accessing the native application THEN the system SHALL provide native file dialogs and drag-and-drop support for easy document management
